## I'm halfway through a 3 hour commute and I've budgeted exactly zero minutes for errors.
One false move and I'll be committing one of the greatest sins in Japanese society - being late to work.

I've managed to avoid it so far, but I live in constant fear of it. My Japanese friends make no attempt to quell my fears or dispel any of the horror stories I've heard about what happens to those who made the unfortunate mistake of being late. Sure, you might be "forgiven" on a superficial level. People might tell you that it's ok. But you know, and everyone else knows, that deep down - no one will forget. Just like you'll always be the kid who accidentally called the teacher "mom", you'll forever be branded as the fool who couldn't get to work on time.

There are already several albatrosses that hang from my neck. They are heavy, they are many, and I must carry them with me each day. The thought of adding one for being late to work in Japan chills me to my very core. It haunts me in a way that makes me always leave over an hour early, but on this morning, I can't.

This morning is special for a few reasons. On one hand, it's going to be one of the last times I'm asked to go sub at a random school in the middle of nowhere on short notice. I've finally been offered a web developer position in Tokyo, and have begun my transition out of English teaching. On the other hand, this school is so far away that even the earliest train will not provide me with any time buffer.

For this reason I've decided to wait until my transfer station to visit a vending machine. This is the only part of the journey where I don't need to be actively walking or riding. Eating is almost never seen on Japanese commuter trains, and while I can get away with some stealth sips of a drink beneath my mask - it feels a little annoying. To me, and to whoever else is watching me. So these 18 minutes between trains are by far the most peace and privacy I will find this morning.

I approach the blinking beverage monolith, and my eyes scan the display window. They are immediately drawn to a can that I don't believe I've seen before.

The subtle blue gradients beneath the golden typography stirs within me a strange sense comfort and familiarity. It's MegaMan, it's Sonic, it's a holographic Pokemon card.

I can hardly contain my excitement as I make my selection and retrieve my cold, metallic treasure from the foot of the machine. I've delayed gratification long enough this morning. Twisting the aluminum cap to a satisfying crack of the seal, the train sign catches my eye.

There, in the LED screen, I see a train bound for my target station about ten minutes earlier than I had anticipated. What a treat. I feel as though the universe is reaching out to give me a very cool handshake. Like the kind with a little snap at the end, or a fist bump where both parties apply the perfect amount of force.
