## If I don't leave the house before it gets dark, I'm going to feel sad and weird for the rest of the night.

I've got two jobs now, and they're both remote for the majority of this month. So on days like today, someone like me might not leave the house at all.

Working from home, like most things I've wished for, can sometimes feel like they were wished for on a monkey's paw. Sometimes there's the incredible feeling of starting one's day with a Tully's Barista Black in the comfort of one's own home. Sometimes it feels like the least favorite people, of one's least favorite place, have invaded the privacy of one's home.

At least that's how I felt at my previous company. I had my desk set up in my bedroom, and my manager was pretty unhappy on most days. I remember thinking, "I'm in my bedroom. I'm getting yelled at in my bedroom."

One of the perks of wearing a fitness watch is I'm actually able to see just how much my resting heart rate has gone down since quitting that job. One of the perks of working in the lower tiers of an industry that's always looking for new people, is that I was able to find a much better job without having to look too hard.

But today is good. I have (what I believe) is a wonderful relationship with my manager at Job A - and it seems as though I'm off to a good start with the team at Job B. So here I am, on a Monday morning - chugging along with my emails, my spreadsheets, my music, and my coffee. If this was your first time looking at me, you might almost think I'm some kind of real, normal person.

The light coming through my kitchen window is starting to dim.

I'm happy with what I've got done today, and I think that the people expecting said emails and spreadsheets will be happy too. But I don't want to be in the house when it gets dark. It's strange. I have no problem coming home and enjoying the night in my house later, but I really don't want to be here alone for the time during which it changes from day to night. I don't know, maybe it's not as hard to explain as I think it is.

Do you remember in the fall of 7th or 8th grade, looking out the window in the final few minutes before the dismissal bell? You could feel the difference in the air, there was a smell to it. You were finally going to be able to wear your favorite hoodie. Great because you loved G-Unit, even better because you were already uncomfortable with your body. Just outside those windows were your friends, bikes with pegs, the skate park, the girls who had already started smoking - all the things you never thought you would one day be grieving the loss of.

And in some way all of those things are still here. At least, the feelings that they inspire are. That's one thing that no one tells you about getting older. That adults are just children in decaying bodies. I still know all the words to Stunt 101. I still go for the girls that I know will make my life harder than it already is. And I miss my friends everyday.

If I don't get outside while it's still light, I'm going to feel like I stayed in the classroom while everyone else got on the bus.

I open the door to what feels like the first truly autumn night of a year that had me sweating through my clothes more than I ever have in my life. I even tried buying these absorbent pads that you stick to the inside of your shirts. They work - to an extent. But you still feel as disgusting as you would had you not been wearing them. They just prevent the world from seeing how uncomfortable you truly are on the inside.

In a way, I guess you could say the same thing about my entire personality. One big absorbent pad of cheap nonsense struggling to hold back an overflowing secret of insecurity and dread. 

And yet things are going well. Really well.

I can't remember the last time things were going this well. I also can't remember the last time I felt this frightened. I'm finally far enough from the bottom where I think a fall to it again might actually kill me.

I can feel myself dismissing the possibility that things could work out. I can feel myself imagining bagging groceries again, coming home to 3 roommates, all in the living room, laughing out load at Saturday Night Live.
 
Some of my older facebook friends like to post low resolution images of inspirational quotes, because of course they do. The one I can't seem to forget about said something along the lines of, "You should always speak kindly to yourself because your inner samurai is listening."

The amount of abuse my inner samurai has suffered at my hands is just horrifying. If my inner samurai was a real person, not only would I be jailed for the unimaginably cruel verbal and physical abuse I put him through, there would be a Netflix miniseries on it. YouTubers would be making documentaries on it. The Try Guys would be treated for PTSD after attempting to react to it.

I don't know if my inner samurai will ever be able to forgive me, or if he's even still alive for that matter. But I would like to believe that he's happy I made it outside before the sun went down.

It's very nearly hoodie weather, and I can only assume he likes G-Unit as much as I do.
