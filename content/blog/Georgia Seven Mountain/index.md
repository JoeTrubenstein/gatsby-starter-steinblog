## I'm expecting big news today, and I'm not confident that I'll be able to handle it if it ends up being bad news.

Applying for jobs is like using a dating app where if you don't get any matches, you have ask your dad for money at the end of the month. Frankly I don't like any of those things. I don't like interviews, I don't like blind first dates, and I don't like humbling myself before my father.

I've done all three of those in August.

But what I really don't like is anything that makes me obsessively check my phone throughout the day, unable to focus on more important things, like learning how to land a kick flip at age 31. I also wish I had more important things to focus on.

I decide to take a walk to a place that always makes me smile regardless of how completely mundane and inconsequential it is. Japanese 7-11. I'm perusing the fridge aisle just passed the teriyaki chicken and egg sandwiches when my eye catches the can of Georgia Seven Mountain Black.

The fact that it's still a big deal to me serves as a reminder that I've made the right choice by moving here. After two years, the novelty of seeing sushi in 7-11 has not worn off. The summers of coming here for beer and cigarettes are gone, but the air conditioning still feels great, and reminds me of the August nights in New Jersey where I would do exactly that, more than a decade ago.

We used to have to lock our car doors before we went inside, because one of the local crazies would get in the back seat and ask you to drive him somewhere when you got back. I never knew what his real name was, but I'll always remember his nickname. Everyone just called him the name of the drug that he had allegedly taken too much of in the 90's which made him become crazy in the first place.

I feel like every hometown has some urban legend of a guy that did too much of something and became the local boogeyman. Or local idiot. I remember hearing about a guy who took a bunch of acid and to this day still thinks he's a big human-sized glass of orange juice. The story was that he would step very slowly and carefully down curbs so he wouldn't spill. And kids would come and table-top him to freak him out. Table-topping is the art of having one kid form a "table-top" by getting on his hands and knees directly behind the legs of your intended victim. You or someone else could then run up and push the person backwards into the table-top, where they would then very easily fall down in a very comical manner.

The people I grew up around who destroyed their lives with drugs at an early age were not quite as humorous as the orange juice man.

I sometimes get angry with God for not giving me a certain degree of clarity at various stages in my life. But I thank him everyday for showing me very early on, what would happen to me if I went down that road. I wish he didn't have to use so many of my friends in demonstrating his point, but I guess that's what people mean when they say he works in mysterious ways.

I check my phone. I don't have any texts or emails.

Well at least I don't think I'm a giant glass of orange juice. That's a kind of logical fallacy - but I forget exactly what it's called. The idea that something is ok because worse things exist. It's not straw man. I also forget how straw man works, but I do like the name.
 
Straw man. Wicker Man.

Imagine that. Getting bamboozled into being burned alive in the wicker man. He thought he was there to save that little girl too. See what can happen even you're trying your hardest to be the good guy? You get the bees, and then you get burned to death in the stupid wicker man.

I've heard people say that sometimes, the best thing that can happen is <em>not</em> getting the job. Obviously the implication there is that getting the job would lead to something bad. Maybe, through some weird butterfly chain of events, getting this job would end with me being burned alive in a straw effigy. 

But if I could be any Nicholas Cage character, it would be Castor Troy in Face-Off. Before 9/11, you could be labeled a terrorist and still be an eccentric millionaire playboy. It was more like a thing for Bond villain types, the word didn't carry any of the connotations that it does today.

I'm not saying I fantasize about being a terrorist. If you followed Troy's character arc, you'd remember the moments revealing his humanity. Then again, they were kind of shown to be hypocrisies on his part. I'm writing myself into a corner here. I guess I'm just trying to say that I would want his wardrobe. And his custom golden M19-11s. And to be respected. And feared.

To some degree, those are the stakes at hand with potentially getting this job. I won't become a millionaire playboy terrorist overnight, but I will feel a little bit better about the Joe that I'm presenting to the world. To my dating app match. To my dad.

I'm thinking about how good it will feel to share the news with them if this works out. I'm also thinking about how I might react if it doesn't. I've outgrown the days in which I might throw myself a big pity party at the bar. No, I don't think there would be any fanfare or attention-seeking at this stage in the game. Realistically, I've probably reached the crying in the shower and re-watching The Sopranos until I can get out of bed in a few weeks stage. 

Over the weekend I've prostrated myself in absolute sincerity to 4 different what one might call "mainstream" gods as genuinely and as respectfully as I can manage. I'm purposely not naming them for that very reason.

The problem I face now, is which one I'm supposed to follow.

Because as one or all of them would have it, the email I just got looks like I got the job.
